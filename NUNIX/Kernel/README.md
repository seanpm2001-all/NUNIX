# README - Kernel

NUNIX is designed for the device that helps the brain. It does not replace the human brain, it simply is like a backup of it, and stores things, so that your brain has more freed up memory. One major advantage of this is that an entire education (from pre-school to the top of College) can be stored here and referenced, instead of memorizing all of it.

Currently, I am deciding on what kernel to use. I just have to make sure it is an open-source trustworthy one, with no tracking or Internet Access. Linux currently is one of my major options (my only option at the moment)
